NAME
    Plack::Middleware::Proxy::Requests - Forward proxy server

SYNOPSIS
      # In app.psgi
      use Plack::Builder;
      use Plack::App::Proxy;

      builder {
          enable "Proxy::Connect";
          enable "Proxy::AddVia";
          enable "Proxy::Requests";
          Plack::App::Proxy->new->to_app;
      };

      # From shell
      plackup -s Twiggy -E Proxy -e 'enable q{AccessLog}' app.psgi

      # or
      twiggy -MPlack::App::Proxy \
             -e 'enable q{AccessLog}; enable q{Proxy::Connect}; \
                 enable q{Proxy::AddVia}; enable q{Proxy::Requests}; \
                 Plack::App::Proxy->new->to_app'

DESCRIPTION
    This module handles HTTP requests as a forward proxy server.

    Its job is to set a `plack.proxy.url' environment variable based on
    `REQUEST_URI' variable.

    The HTTP responses from the Internet might be invalid. In that case it
    is required to run the server without Plack::Middleware::Lint module.
    This module is started by default and disabled if `-E' or
    `--no-default-middleware' option is used when starting plackup script.
    Note that this disable also Plack::Middleware::AccessLog so it have to
    be enabled explicitly if needed.

    The default server Plack::Server::PSGI alias `Standalone' can hang up on
    stalled connection. It is better to run proxy server with Starlet,
    Starman or Twiggy.
